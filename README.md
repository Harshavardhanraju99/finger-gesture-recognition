# 🎨 Virtual Painter – Hand Gesture Drawing Using OpenCV & Mediapipe

This project is a gesture-controlled virtual painting application that allows users to draw on a screen using their index finger, detected via a webcam. Built with OpenCV and Mediapipe, it provides an intuitive way to paint without needing a physical pen or touchscreen.

# ✨ Features

✅ Hand Tracking: Detects and tracks fingers using Mediapipe Hands.

✅ Gesture-Based Drawing: Use your index finger as a brush and start painting!

✅ Color Selection: Choose between Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow by tapping the color buttons.

✅ Eraser/Clear Option: Tap the "CLEAR" button to reset the canvas.

✅ Dynamic Control: Pinching with the thumb and index finger stops drawing (like lifting a pen).

✅ Real-Time Processing: Efficient tracking with minimized lag using OpenCV.

#🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV – For real-time image processing

Mediapipe – For hand tracking and gesture recognition

NumPy – For efficient array operations

🚀 Installation & Usage

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Installation Steps

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Harshavardhanraju99/Virtual-Painter.git
cd Virtual-Painter

2️⃣ Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

3️⃣ Run the script:

python virtual_painter.py

4️⃣ Start drawing using your index finger! 🎨

# 🎯 How It Works

Start the application – It opens two windows: the webcam feed and a blank canvas.

Select a color – Tap the colored buttons at the top using your index finger.

Draw on the screen – Move your index finger while keeping it extended.

Stop drawing – Bring your thumb close to your index finger (pinching motion).

Clear the canvas – Tap the "CLEAR" button.

Exit the application – Press q on your keyboard.

# 🔥 Future Enhancements

🖌️ Add custom brush sizes controlled via hand gestures.

🎨 Implement more colors & UI improvements.

💾 Allow saving the drawing as an image file.

📏 Add line thickness variation based on finger distance.
